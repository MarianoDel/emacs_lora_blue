* Template firmware for Arduino BluePill - STM32F103C8 -
** Bare - Metal registers access
** To program
   - use stlink-v2 on .1 pins
   - the two jumpers on 0 position
   - program with 
     $ make flash
   - after program push reset

** Problems on first program download
   - at first time (I dont know, maybe its already saved) its not possible
     to program, what I did..
   - move board jumpers to 1 position
   - program (now works!)
   - move jumpers to 0 position and reset
   - now continue programming its possible
